dynamic prog properties-
1. optimal substructure - 
if any problem's overall sol can be constructed from the optimal solutions 
of its subproblem, then it has optimal substructure.

ex - fibonacci series

2. overlapping subproblem-
instead of doing the same subproblem multiple times we just use the
solutions of the prev subproblem to do the later one and so on.
we cannot do this for divide and conquer
