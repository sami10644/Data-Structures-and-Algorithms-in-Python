Tree problem â€“ A tree node can either be an internal node or a leaf node.
If it is an internal node then it stores the sum of lengths of strings present in its left and right child.
If it is a leaf node then it stores string as well as its length.

A cord tree is a binary tree of strings.
A node in this tree can be a leaf node or an internal node.
An internal node has two children, a left child and a right child. It also has a length of all the children under it
A leaf nodes have a value and a length

Given input is above tree and N when You have to return the Nth character present in the tree.
